This is a wordlist collection of common web applications, created by indexing the directory and file structure of the applications and refined with paths scraped from the respective source code. Useful for discovery of even the most hard to find assets during security assessments or bug bounty hunting.

### Caveat
Due to the simple minded way of scraping the source code for possible routes which are not reflected in the directory structure, a substantial amount of nonsense is contained in the wordlists.

### Information
**Directories:** Exclusively contains directory paths, based both on file structure and source code scraping.
**Files:** Exclusively contains file paths, based both on file structure and source code scraping. This one contains a lot of nonsense.
**Combined:** Both of the above combined, for maximum coverage.

### Plans
Both automate the creation of these wordlists and increase the percision of scraped routes from code. Primarly by not doing in the monkey way with just throwing a regex pattern at it.
